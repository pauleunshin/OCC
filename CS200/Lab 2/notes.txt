What went wrong?
- Tried to use == operator on an array index which wasn't initialized
 > Gave me address instead of values i wanted
 > Either need to initialize with all values at a start value
 > Make check conditional for true/false


- Honestly rest was just me being stupid and not writing code in chunks and trying to brute force the entire code
- Take my time and write code in chunks
- I could've knocked this out in an hour or two but instead it took 5+. 


lab_2 vs lab_2alt
- Weird requirement to not start the BFS with the first vertex in a queue
- Added like 8 lines. I don't want to bother to shorten it and I'll just follow it
- lab_2alt has my original code with adding start vertex to queue


- BFS don't add the start vertex to the queue only the BFS list ig
